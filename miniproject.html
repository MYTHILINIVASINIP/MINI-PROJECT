      <h2>Khajuraho Temples, Madhya Pradesh</h2>
      <p>Khajuraho has always been thought of as the place that exemplifies sensuality and eroticism at its best. However this is a misrepresentation as only about 10 percent of the sculptures are sensual and the rest are common depictions. Countless sculptures depicting love, eternal grace, beauty, delicacy and the creative arts can be seen in one of the most historical places in India. A perfect amalgamation of Hinduism and Jainism, Khajuraho temples have carvings of cult icons, demi gods and Apsaras.</p>

The lowest level of the stepwell was earlier used as a route to escape to neighbouring villages. It is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Gujarat.<br><br></p>
